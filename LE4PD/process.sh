#Note: this file has been setup to run on the shared nodes on the Comet supercomputer at the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC).
#Documentation for this cluster is here:
#
#                                                 https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/comet.html
#
#Comet uses the SLURM scheduler to manage and submit jobs. To submit this job on Comet, run 'sbatch process.pbs'. 
#To run this file in the shell, use either 'sh process.sh' or 'bash process.sh'. If running locally, comment out the line
#reading 'module load gromacs'.
#
#This script also requires GROMACS (gromacs.org) be installed and parallelized with MPI. However, the processing commands here are
#run in serial, and thus a parallelized version of GROMACS is not required to run these processing commands. If the version of 
#GROMACS installed on your machine is not parallelized, simply change the line reading 'gmx=`which gmx_mpi`' to 'gmx=`which gmx`', which 
#will find the (serial) GROMACS executable on your machine.
#
#The topology file (the variable named 'top') can be any topology file recognized by GROMACS (.tpr, .pdb, .gro, etc.). Likewise with the trajectory ('traj')
#file. 
#
#Finally, this code is designed to write the alpha-carbons of the protein of interest to the .g96, .gro, and .pdb output files. The code assumes that the 
#group stored in index 1 of the topology file corresponds to the atoms of the protein and group 3 to the protein's alpha-carbons. If this is not the case,
#then the groups specified in the 'echo' commands prefixing the GROMACS processing commands must be adjusted accordingly -- the user should see the GROMACS
#documentation for more details.
